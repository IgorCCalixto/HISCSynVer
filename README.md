# HISCSynVer
The programs presented here are based on Discrete Events Systens, Supervisory Control Theory and Hierarchical Interface-based Supervisory Control (HISC), so that they were developed through the UltraDes library based on Visual Studio software, created by LACSED | UFMG.

The purpose of these programs is the application of HISC's serial, parallel and multilevel architectures for the turning station of a computer integrated manufacturing platform, called Mecatrime plant, located at the Instituto Militar de Engenharia (IME).

For this, a program was developed for the serial and parallel case and a program for the multilevel case, so that software was created for synthesis and verification of the supervisors obtained according to the properties of HISC, based on the available literature. All of these programs are part of the work developed for the conclusion of the master's degree in Electrical Engineering at IME.

In addition to the programs mentioned, an example program, called Toy example, was developed to facilitate the understanding of the developed software.
 
For the understanding of UltraDes, it is recommended to enter page https://github.com/lacsed/UltraDES, where they explain how the procedure for using it is. In addition to the tools provided by UltraDes, it was necessary to develop others, available in the programs, to facilitate the calculations presented.
